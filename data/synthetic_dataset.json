    "reference":"The sentiments regarding secession were complex, as there was a strong desire to preserve the Union while also addressing the rights and interests of slaveholding states. In Arkansas, there was a significant push for secession, with the state authorities seizing an arsenal and expressing a desire to join the Southern Confederacy. However, there were also calls for a conference of slaveholding states at Nashville to discuss guarantees for their rights within the Union. The discussions emphasized that if the South could not obtain such guarantees, they would insist on an equitable division of public property and public debt, and if necessary, they would resort to conflict to defend their rights. This reflects the tension between the desire for unity and the willingness to separate if their interests were not adequately protected.",

The great\nadvantage the Bitters possess over ordinary\nstimulants usually prescribed in treating lung\ncomplaints and kindred diseases, Is the fact that\nthey combine many safe and certain healing\nproperties in connection with the best known\nstimulant.\n\n\nDELICATE LADIES\n\n\nWill derive great benefit from It, No unpleasant\neffect will result from taking the Bitters If\nthe directions are followed.
