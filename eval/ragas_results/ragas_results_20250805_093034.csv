Leroy Pope Walker is a lawyer Of\nHuntsville, Alabama, a native Of that county,\nMadison, and about forty-hve years OF age.\nHe il the eldest son Of the late Mai. Walker,\nand one Of a family distinguished for talent\nand influence. Two Of bis brothers are Hon\nPercy Walker, who recently represented the\nMobile district in Congress, and Hon. judge\nRichard W. Walker, Of Florence, chairman Of\nthe Alabama delegation in the present Con-\nfederste Congress. Hon. L. P Walker at one\ntime praetieed law in South Alabama and was\nfer several sessions speaker of the house Of\nrepresentatives Of the State He has been a\nconsistent democrat Of the State rights school.\nFor the last ten yeare be has been located 10\nHuntsville, and has the reputation Of being\nthe leading lawyer, and next to Clay, the lead\ning Democrat Of North Alabama. Careful in\nthe preparation of his cause, and clear, con\nelse, logical and eloquent in presenting them\nbefore court, be is said to be an eminently sue\ncessful practitioner For the last three years\nbe has been conspicuous In his denuncfation\nOf the free soil heresy Of squatteT sovereignty.\nIn the Alabama Democratic convention which\ntook ground against 1t, and sent a delegation\nto Charleston tc carry out her instructed op-\nposition, Gen. Walkers influence was marked\nand effective. He was one of the delegation\nsent here, and exsrted himself ably in resist |\ning the compromises offered. The result all\nknow. He has been leader In the cause of\nthe South, and deserves a good place in the\npicture. As a man Of clear head, good iudg-\nment, systematic and laborious in his habits,\nwith undoubted nerve, spirit, energy and will,\nwe cannot help thinking he is an excellent\nelection for the Department Of War at the\npresent juneture.\n\n\nSECRETARY OF THE NAVY. al\n\n\nHon.

The post of Secretary Of\nthe Navy to the Confederate States is post\nrequiring prompt energy and sound practical\njudgment. A navy is to be organized, and as |\nwe have recently had occasion to suggest at\nlength, the manner Of that organization is Of 1\nlasting consequence. Upon the wisdom eXer- i\ncised in fitting it 10 the wants Of the South, 1\nand that as early as practicable, much proper /\nty and many lives, not to say the confederate 4\ncharacter before the world, may depend Mr.. /\nPerkins bears a high character, and we trust 4\nwill prove himself folly equal to the task."", ""20 are seriously wounded, though Il il not\nthought fatally.\n\n\nComparative quiet nov prevails.

I reckon you’re interested in the arts, as he is known largely for his work in illustrating. In the articles I’ve seen circulating around our town, he is attached to a publication entitled “The Poetry of Nature.” It seems Mr. Weir is quite the gifted artist, selected to illustrate poetry that speaks of nature—a fine endeavor, indeed.

His illustrations are appreciated by many who delight in both poetry and the beauty of the world. I imagine he brings a special charm to the verses with his illustrations, making them resonate even more profoundly with readers. Art and literature provide such solace in these troubled times, don’t you think? While we face uncertainty and strife in our nation, it’s comforting to see folks like Mr. Weir contributing to the culture and spirit of our society.

If you’re inclined, I’d suggest taking a look at his work. It might just lift your spirits and offer a moment of respite from the heavy news we encounter daily.",Harrison Weir is the illustrator of 'THE POETRY OF NATURE.',0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.9999999999,1.0
